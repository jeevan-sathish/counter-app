# ⚡ Dynamic Counter App

A powerful and interactive **React + TypeScript + Vite** application that demonstrates state management, conditional rendering, and auto power-off functionality — all packed into a clean and dynamic counter interface.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This **Dynamic Counter App** lets users manually input increment and decrement values, view the current stage value, and interact with the counter through intuitive controls.  
It also features a **power control system** that enables or disables buttons, and a **smart auto-shutdown** that turns off the system after 15 minutes of inactivity.
